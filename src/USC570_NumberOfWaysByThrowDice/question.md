Let's say you have a dice with m sides numbered from 1 to m, and you are throwing in n times, If the side with number i is facing up you will receive i points. Consider the variable z which is the summation of your points when you throw the dices n times. We want to find the number of ways we can end up with the summation z after n throws. We want to do this using dynamic programming.
