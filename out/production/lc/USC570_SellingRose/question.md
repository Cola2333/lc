Suppose you want to sell n rose. You need to group the roses into multiple bouquets with different size. The value of each bouquet depends on the number of roses you used. In other word, we know that a bouquet of size i will sell for v[i] dollars. Provide an algorithm to find the maximum possible value of the roses by deciding how to group them into different sized bouqets.

Here is an example:
input: n = 5, v[1, ..., n] = [2, 3, 7, 8, 10] (a bouquet of size 1 is $2, bouquet of size 2 is $3 ...) Excepted output = 11(bouquet of size 1, 1, 3)
