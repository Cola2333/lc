You are considering opening a series of electrical vehicle charging stations along
Pacific Coast Highway (PCH). There are n possible locations along the highway,
and the distance from the start to location k is d k  ≥ 0, where k = 1, 2, …, n. You
may assume that d i  <d k for i < k. There are two important constraints:
1) at each location k you can open only one charging station with the expected
profit p k , k = 1, 2, …, n.
2) you must open at least one charging station along the whole highway.
3) any two stations should be at least M miles apart.
Give a DP algorithm to find the maximum expected total profit subject to the given
constraints.
